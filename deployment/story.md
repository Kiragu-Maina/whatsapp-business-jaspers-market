I want u to read my deployment/config.py, create a python venv in  deployment/venv, install paramiko in it, and using the variables in config, ssh into the vps, go into the vps, check if port 4577 for frontend and api respectively are in use... I've updated docker mapping to that... then go to /etc/nginx/sites-available.. read how wandolaenergysystems.co.ke the conf, is.. copy it as is to whatsapp.alkenacode.dev remove the ssl certificate entries as these will be added later by certbot... update the ports for / it be 4577  take note of the specific formatting of the slashes..  then after all this run ln -s, then run certbot for whatsapp.alkenacode.dev
